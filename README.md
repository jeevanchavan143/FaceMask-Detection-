# FaceMask-Detection-
Facemask detection using tensorflow and OpenCv

Step 1: Collecting Dataset 
First we need to create Dataset to train our model.
We need to types of Images for this project. i.e.With mask and Without Mask 
Its difficult task to download images manually one by one from the Google images,
So We will install chrome extension "Fatkun" to download images in batch 

To download the extension : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/nnjjahlikiabnchcpehcpkdeckfgnohf?hl=en

Now we will download 300 images of person wearing Mask and without Mask 

One of the best site to download Images: https://generated.photos/faces#

We are done with Dataset Collection now.
Create two seperate folder mask and NoMask. Save all downloaded images in that folder.
